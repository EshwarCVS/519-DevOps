# HW0-DevOps

CSC 519 - DevOps


- Explain the difference between nightly builds, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment
Nightly builds - Build executable and run smoke test to see whether the product "smokes" when it runs
CI - A practice where evelopers automatically build, test, analyze a software change in response to every software change committed to the source repository
CD - A practice that ensures that a software change can be delivered and ready for use by a customer by testing in production-like environments. Continuous Delivery is treated as extension of Continuous Integration (CI/CD). Includes configuration management of deployed software. Staging and acceptance testing. Basic deployment strategies.
CD -  A practice where incremental software changes are automatically tested, vetted, and released in production environments. More automation in pipeline. Feature experimentation, metrics and monitoring. Testing in production; resilience and chaos engineering.
